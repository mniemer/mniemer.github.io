        <p>I'm Matt, a junior studying computer science at <a href="http://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" class="links">Northwestern University</a>. 
        I really like working at the intersection of games, music, and tech.</p>
        
        <p>I've previously worked at <a href="http://hagerty.com" target="_blank" class="links">Hagerty Insurance Agency</a>, 
        and I'm currently involved in a couple of great projects on campus.
        Here is my <a href="mattniemer_resume.pdf" target="_blank" class="links">resume</a> - you can reach me anytime at 
        <a href="mailto:mattniemer@u.northwestern.edu" target="_blank" class="links">mattniemer@u.northwestern.edu</a>.</p>
        
        <p>In my spare time, I play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZkLYZf734" target="_blank" class="links">ultimate frisbee</a>, 
        enjoy the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204388312620021&l=9b30e63cd3" target="_blank" class="links">great outdoors</a>, 
        and play an unhealthy amount of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f14qok9XosY" target="_blank" class="links">Tetris</a>.</p>

                of this project is to create a robotic lacrosse goalie which will be used by the club lacrosse team at Northwestern.</p>
                <p>I began my role as lead programmer for this project in the fall of 2016. I'm working with a small team to implement
                a lightning fast vision system which will be integrated with a motor controller.

                <p>I worked with a partner to create a tool which can be used to identify different kinds of violin tone and diagnose the underlying cause of poor tone quality.
                The solution employs a nearest neighbor classifier trained on a set of audio features extracted from a collection of violin tone samples.</p>

                <p>My friends and I developed a simple, yet full puzzle game from scratch in Unity. We recieved a good amount of positive feeback from playtesters and we are planning on continuing work on the game with plans to release a build to the public for PC and Mac.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b><a href="https://github.com/mniemer/tetris" target="_blank" class="links">Tetris</a></b>
                <p>I have a deep love of Tetris. In an effort to practice starting a project from scratch,
                I decided to build a working local version of my favorite game. I used the 
                <a href="http://pygame.org/hifi.html" target="_blank" class="links">pygame</a> package in Python,
                which proved to be very conenient for managing and drawing sprites. </p>
                <p>I began this project over the summer in 2016, and I have not yet finished.
